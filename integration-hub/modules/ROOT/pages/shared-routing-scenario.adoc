s|_YourCompany_ B2B : PartB
|Your organization's relationship with the partner with whom you are doing business (in this case, *PartB*)
|Contains artifacts used only with Partner *PartB*

== Artifacts and Artifact Configuration 

This section identifies:

* Artifacts that must be configured in order for the document in this scenario to be routed (that is, not rejected)
* The Relationship (either *__YourCompany__ B2B : Any* or *__YourCompany__ B2B : PartA*, or *__YourCompany__ B2B : PartB*) in which the artifacts are configured


//==== Configured in *YourCompany B2B : Any*

== Outcomes

=== Document Accepted and Routed

==== *PartA* sends Document of Document Type *Y* to Endpoint *RecFromA*

[[img-shared-routing-scenario-outcome-parta-success]]

image::shared-routing-scenario-outcome-parta-success.png[img-shared-routing-scenario-outcome-parta-success, title="Shared Routing Scenario Outcome, PartA, Success"]

Integration Manager:

* Receives Document *Y*
** Attempts to resolve routes
** Finds Transaction *Y-to-X-to-API*
* Executes that transaction, which maps the transaction to *X*
*  Sends Document *X* to Endpoint *API*.

==== *PartB* sends Document of Document Type *Y* to Endpoint *RecFromB*



Integration Manager:

* Receives Document *Y*
* Attempts to resolve routes
** Finds Transaction *Y-to-X-to-API*
** Executes that transaction, which maps the transaction to *X*
*  Sends Document *X* to Endpoint *API*.

=== Document Rejected

==== PartC sends Document of Document Type *Y* to Endpoint *RecFromB*

[[img-shared-routing-scenario-outcome-rejection]]

image::shared-routing-scenario-outcome-rejection.png[img-shared-routing-scenario-outcome-rejection, title="Shared Scenario Outcome (Rejection)"]

Integration Manager:
