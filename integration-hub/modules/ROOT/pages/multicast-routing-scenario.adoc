= Multicast Routing Scenario 


In this example of a multicast routing scenario, an xref:glossary#a[Application] sends a xref:glossary#d[Document] to three other Applications. Two of the Applications require the Document as-sent; the third requires the payload to be mapped.

== Background Reading

xref:actors-relationships-and-artifacts.adoc[Actors, Relationships and Artifacts]:: Introduces foundational IHub terminology. 

xref:transaction-processing-framework.adoc[Transaction-Processing Framework]:: Explains how IHub works.

== xref:glossary#a[Actor]s

In this scenario, there are three xref:glossary#a[Actor]s: 
    
* Application A (configured as *AppA*)
* Application B (configured as *AppB*)
* Application C (configured as *AppC*)
* Application D (configured as *AppD*)
* *_YourCompany_ B2B*
* *Any*

=== Relationships

There are seven xref:glossary#r[Relationships] in this scenario:

== xref:glossary#a[Artifact]s 

The tables and flow diagrams in this section identify:

* Artifacts that must be configured in order for a given document to be routed (that is, not rejected)
* The Relationship in which the artifacts are configured

== Outcomes

=== AppA sends Document of Document Type Y to Endpoint RecFromA

Integration Hub:

* Receives the document on *RecFromA*

* Attempts to resolve routes
* Finds three Transactions 
** *Y-Passthrough-to-B* 
** *Y-Passthrough-to-C*
** *Y-to-X-to-D*
* Executes all transactions:

** Sends Document of Type *Y* to Endpoint *B*.

** Sends Document of Type *Y* to Endpoint *C*.

** Maps Document of Type *Y* to Document Type *X*, then sends it to  Endpoint **AppD**.
