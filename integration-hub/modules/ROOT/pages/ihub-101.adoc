= Integration Hub 101

Goals :: 
* Receive a
xref:glossary#sectd[Document] 
from a 
xref:glossary#sectp[Partner]
* xref:glossary#sectm[Map] 
the document from your Partner's
xref:glossary#sectd[Document Type]
to an internal (to your company) Document Type 
* Send the document to an internal database

Steps ::

* Create Partner *PartA*
* Enter 
xref:glossary#sectr[Relationship]
*GearCo B2B : PartA*
* Create new 
xref:glossary#sectt[Transaction] 
** Create 
xref:glossary#sects[Source Channel] 
*** Create 
xref:glossary#sectd[Document Type] *Y*
**** Add 
xref:glossary#secte[Endpoint] *RecFromA*
*** Create 
xref:glossary#sectd[Document Type] 
*X*
*** Create 
xref:glossary#sectm[Map] 
** Create 
xref:glossary#sectt[Target Channel] 
*** Select Document Type *X* for *Source Document*
*** Create new Endpoint 





== Actors

* YourCompany B2B
* PartA
** certs
** identifiers

== Relationships
*facilitate integration
* aritifacts live inside
* partition
* scope for reuse of artifacts

This scenario
PartA sends you some kind of doc
sends to endpoint you setup 
doc y
map to doc x (internal)
maybe x12 to json tps
internal api endpoint

== steps

1. what to do with it when i receive 
2. where do i want to send it

1 is source channel
2 is target channel

may have multiple target channels from one source channel

combo of channels is a Transaction - IHub built around these

Transaction is inside o relationship

== Setting up in IHub

Monitoring screen
Partners and Apps
Add PartA
bonus add certs and IDs

Enter AA : PartA
Enter TD
Create new transaction
Reverse from and to
so partA is sending to 
Create source channel

source doc, map, target doc
create source doc y
possible endpoints
add new endpoint RecFromA
http
port 0.0.0.0
receive path

new doc
doc x

new map
dataweave
add script


new target channel
existing doc y (x)
new endpoint
http
localhost
path /api

quick view
save
see source channel, target channel, and route success

td - see what happens
