= Debatching Groups of Incoming Documents

Incoming documents often serve as containers for other documents. To facilitate processing both the container documents and the contained documents, each container is copied into _x_ identical container documents, where _x_ is the number of documents that the original container document contains. This process is known as _debatching_.
The most common formats for which this process is used are X12 and XML.

This section shows how GearCo creates document types to enable debatching of incoming orders from its partner AAZBoards. 

== X12 Documents

Purchase orders (POs) sent in X12 format are typically enclosed in a GS envelope, which is in turn enclosed in an ISA envelope. In order to process the POs, they must be _debatched_: that is, separated so that each PO is enclosed in its own GSA and ISA envelopes, as shown in <<img-isa-gs-st-debatching>>.

xref:debatching-incoming-x12-documents.adoc[Debatching Incoming X12 Documents] shows how GearCo uses xref:document-types.adoc[Document Types] to debatch an ISA envelope containing a GS and multiple STs. 


== XML Documents

Product orders sent in XML format are typically enclosed in a parent container. In order to process the product orders, they must be _debatched_: that is, separated so that each product order is enclosed in its parent container, as shown in <<img-xml-debatching>>.

= Consider cutting here

=== Before you begin

* Make sure that you have xref:partner-configuration.adoc#create-and-configure-partners[created the partner] from which you want to receive documents.


=== Get Started

. In the *CONFIGURATION* section of the left-hand navigation pane on the xref:partner-configuration.adoc#img-company-information[Company Information Page], click *Document Definitions*.
+ 
The <<img-document-types-none-added>> appears.

[[img-document-types-none-added]]

image::document-types-none-added.png[img-document-types-none-added, title="Document Types Page"]

[start=2]

. On the <<img-document-types-none-added>>, click *New*.
+
The <<img-document-type>> appears.

[[img-document-type]]

=== Create Document Types

[start=3]

. In the *Standard* box, select *X12*.
. In the *Version* box, select *5010*.
. In the *Message Type* box, select *PO (850 - Purchase Order)*.
+
To create the GS, click *Save*.
+
The Saving X12 Document Type box appears.

[[img-saving-x12-document-type]]

image::saving-x12-document-type.png[img-saving-x12-document-type, title="Saving X12 Document Type Box"]

[start=6]


. In the <<img-saving-x12-document-type>>, click *Auto-generate Inbound ISA and GS* to generate these Document Types. 
+
If the Document Types are successfully generated, messages to that effect appear in the <<img-saving-x12-document-type>>.
+
If you do not want to generate these Document Types - for example, when you want to specify custom fields for a given document type or types - click *Continue Without Linking*. 
. In the <<img-saving-x12-document-type>>, click *Continue*.
+
The <<img-document-types-parents-children>> appears, displaying the three new documents:

* The parent ISA document type, with one child document type (the GSA)
* The GSA document type, which is both a parent (of the 850 document type) and a child (of the ISA)
* The 850 Purchase Order (hereafter cited as "the 850") document type, which is a child of the GSA.

=== Verify Debatching Settings

. To verify that the PO document type you have created is set to debatch, on the <<img-document-types-parents-children>>, click the PO. 
+
The <<img-document-type>> appears, displaying the details of the 850. 
. On the <<img-document-type>>, click *Parents*. 
+
The <<img-document-type-parents-tab>> appears, displaying the parent GS.

=== About Automatic Debatching

Note that, in <<img-document-type-parents-tab>>, automatic debatching is selected for the GS Document Type, and a shredding path is configured; if you were to view the corresponding page and tab for the GS and ISA documents, you would see that they are also configured in this manner. Thus, when this ISA Document Type is received, it will automatically debatch from an ISA containing a GS containing _x_ 850s to _x_ separate ISAs, each containing a GS and an 850, as shown in <<img-isa-gs-st-debatching>>.
