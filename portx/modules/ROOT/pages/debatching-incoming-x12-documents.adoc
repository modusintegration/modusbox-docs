= Debatching Incoming X12 Document Sets

Purchase orders (POs) sent in X12 format are typically enclosed in a GS envelope, which is in turn enclosed in an ISA envelope. In order to process the POs, they must be _debatched_: that is, separated so that each PO is enclosed in its own GSA and ISA envelopes, as shown in <<img-isa-gs-st-debatching>>.

This page shows how GearCo uses xref:document-types.adoc[Document Types] to debatch an ISA envelope containing a GS and multiple STs.   

== Before you begin

* Make sure that you have xref:partner-configuration.adoc#create-and-configure-partners[created the partner] from which you want to receive documents.


== Get Started

. In the *CONFIGURATION* section of the left-hand navigation pane on the xref:partner-configuration.adoc#img-company-information[Company Information Page], click *Document Definitions*.
+ 
The <<img-document-types-none-added>> appears.

[start=6]


. In the <<img-saving-x12-document-type>>, click *Auto-generate Inbound ISA and GS* to generate these Document Types. 
+
If the Document Types are successfully generated, messages to that effect appear in the <<img-saving-x12-document-type>>.
+
If you do not want to generate these Document Types - for example, when you want to specify custom fields for a given document type or types - click *Continue Without Linking*. 
. In the <<img-saving-x12-document-type>>, click *Continue*.
+
The <<img-document-types-parents-children>> appears, displaying the three new documents:

* The parent ISA document type, with one child document type (the GSA)
* The GSA document type, which is both a parent (of the 850 document type) and a child (of the ISA)
* The 850 Purchase Order (hereafter cited as "the 850") document type, which is a child of the GSA.

== About Automatic Debatching

Note that, in <<img-document-type-parents-tab>>, automatic debatching is selected for the GS Document Type, and a shredding path is configured; if you were to view the corresponding page and tab for the GS and ISA documents, you would see that they are also configured in this manner. Thus, when this ISA Document Type is received, it will automatically debatch from an ISA containing a GS containing _x_ 850s to _x_ separate ISAs, each containing a GS and an 850, as shown in <<img-isa-gs-st-debatching>>.
